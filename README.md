There is a method to practice Patriarch Zen, a form of meditation that has been passed down through generations of patriarchs: the investigative meditation. Investigative meditation differs from sitting meditation, and vice versa. Many people mistakenly believe that sitting meditation equates to investigative meditation; however, practitioners of investigative meditation do not necessarily need to sit. According to the patriarchs, engaging in investigative meditation while participating in daily activities is more beneficial than sitting quietly to meditate, as those who choose the latter often have little hope of perceiving the true nature of the mind.

The Sixth Patriarch stated, “Your mind, not your body, understands the Way.” The chapter on Sitting Meditation in the Platform Sutra explains that sitting meditation signifies that “the mind sits, not the body,” and that “sitting means that while you confront all good and evil externally, your thoughts have no place in your mind; meditation means that inwardly, you perceive the unmoving self-nature.” So, what is investigating meditation? The term “investigating” refers to “doubting” or “working on something you do not yet understand.” When you grasp the problem, the doubt dissipates, and the act of investigating ceases to exist. Therefore, investigating meditation centers on the doubt, or, in other words, “the feeling of doubt.”

To cultivate a sense of doubt, you should rely on the huatou; this is the essence of investigative meditation. What is a huatou? Zen Master Hu Van explains that before you articulate a sentence, you must first generate a thought; a huatou represents the state of mind that exists prior to the emergence of a thought. When a thought arises, even before you speak, it is already the conclusion of a sentence. As you begin your investigative meditation, even if you have not yet reached a huatou, do not remain fixated on the conclusion of the sentence. Instead, you are moving away from the conclusion and progressing toward a huatou—eventually, you will arrive at one. At that moment, the huatou will dissipate; if the huatou continues to occupy your mind, it indicates that you have not yet attained it.

Zen Master Xuyun or Hsu Yun states, “The huatou is like a walking stick, and the feeling of doubt is akin to the act of walking. Just as someone with an injured leg must depend on a walking stick to progress, raising the feeling of doubt must depend on a huatou.”.

There are numerous huatous, and I cannot count them all. I will now present five huatous. Each of you, the practitioners, should select the one you believe will be the most challenging. The most suitable huatou for you is the one you have no understanding of whatsoever, and the one you think that you will never understand. Just select one huatou, not two. Once you have chosen a huatou, do not turn to another; instead, continue with your investigative meditation until you realize the true nature of the mind.

Five popular huatous are as follows:

⚡️ Who was I before the creation of heaven and earth?

⚡️ All things return to the One. To where does the One return?

⚡️ What did your face look like before your parents were born?

⚡️ Where were you before your birth, and where will you go after your death?

⚡️ What is it that is neither the mind, nor the Buddha, nor any objects?

Huatou is a question. When a question is posed, an answer must follow. For instance, the question “Who was I before the existence of heaven and earth?” arises in your mind, and you may feel unable to provide an answer. The more you become entangled in the question, the more you feel doubt growing, the more it manifests as what we refer to as “the feeling of doubt” or “the sensation of doubt.” Initially, you pose a question but cannot find an answer. Then, you repeat this process a second time, and again a third time. You continue to raise the question endlessly, day and night; you pose it constantly, whether you are walking, standing, lying down, sitting, driving, eating, working—either physically or mentally—using the toilet, or even while sleeping. Just keep raising the question ceaselessly.

Beginners often forget to ask questions and find it challenging to maintain constant mindfulness. During the first few days, their practice may be interrupted for 23 hours out of a 24-hour day. Over time, the duration of these interruptions will decrease, first to 22 hours, then to 21 hours, and eventually to 20 hours. Gradually, their practice will flow continuously and smoothly throughout the entire day.

When the practice of a flowing stream of consciousness solidifies into a firm foundation, it is referred to as  at huatou the top of a hundred-foot pole. From this vantage point, taking one more step forward allows you to perceive your true nature; thus, you achieve liberation and remain free from all suffering for eternity.
